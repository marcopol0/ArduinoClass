# ArduinoClass
Useful class to put on arduino Libraries
This project is for me for not reprogramming each time my sensor 

1) Choose the class that interest you
2) Copy on your libraries folder (arduino/libraries)
3) Use the class (one readme by class)

If you find a mistake please let me know :) ! Thanks

Marc
